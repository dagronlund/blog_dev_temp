title: Quick Update 
---

I figured I should write some stop-gap update while I work on my next big posts, so that’s what this is. I haven’t posted in a while because of (in order) finals, being sick, vacation with family, being sick again, the flu, and the start of the semester. Despite this, I have been working on a few interesting projects. Over break, I was mainly working on my updated chess engine in Java which uses more modern techniques compared to my old one. I also made a simple emulator in C# for a simplified assembly language for a project with a friend of mine. I think both of these projects have some interesting aspects to them, so I have been working on a blog post going over both of them. I imagine I’ll finish it in the next week or two. 

I’ve also been working on learning Verilog and I continue to work on learning x86-64. 

And that’s really all I have for now, I just wanted to make a quick update to note that I was still here and that this blog isn’t dead.
