title: My New Blog!
---
I decided I should probably have something that documents the hot mess that is my [GitHub](https://github.com/) so I created this blog. I think I'll use this blog to write about projects that I'm working on in my free time (and maybe some for school). 

I decided to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for my blog after [a friend of mine](https://dagronlund.github.io) started his own blog the same way. I used a prebuilt theme and [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), instead of making a custom blog, so I didn't have much trouble setting anything up. I think I'll slowly work on customizing this theme (it is the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme), but it works for now. 

The project I've been working on most recently is a C++ rendering engine (which you can find on my GitHub). I wrote another 3d engine around 5 years ago with the aforementioned friend of mine. It was the biggest project I had ever worked on, and I think I would benefit a lot from going over that entire code base and evaluating the decisions 13 year old me made back then. I'm planning on putting this "code review" on this blog. I will be doing it in a couple parts, as the engine is around 11,000 lines of code, so stay tuned for that.

Oh and,
{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
void main() {
	std::cout << "hello world!" << std::endl;
}
{% endhighlight %}
