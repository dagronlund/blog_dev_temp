It occurred to me early this week that my blog was a bit of a mess. Since I created the blog, I have been having problems with the permanent links to individual posts. After my last post, I noticed that some of the links were linking to unformatted pages. Today I noticed that the title link was broken as well. I decided today was as good of a day as any to clean it up and fix everything, so I did.

I&#39;m also finished with my project for computer science, and I think it is pretty cool, so I plan to write a post about what it is, what went well, and what I could&#39;ve done better. Hopefully I&#39;ll get a chance to write that in the next couple days.

Oh, and I also stumbled upon Google Foobar last week, so I've been working on that. I'm currently on level 4.
