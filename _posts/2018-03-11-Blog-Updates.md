title: Updated Blog!
---

I finally am getting around to modernizing my this website. I've moved to a new, much more sophisticated theme for Jekyll
and I'm working on making this more of a "personal site" than a blog. I'm pretty busy with school (as always), so it'll probably
take a while before everything is working well again. A lot of pages that I had on the old version of this site are going to be
completely remade (like the "About" page), so those probably aren't going to be done for a while.

For now, enjoy the new layout and all the fun new bugs that come with it.
