This blog has been dead for a while (and I didn't write several of the post-mortem posts I said I would) because I've been working as an intern at CA Technologies for the last few months. Now that the summer is over, I'm done working for a bit and I have some time to work on this blog.

My current side project is a small Java library called [Cutter](https://github.com/Spaceman1701/Cutter). It's goal is to add basic aspect-oriented programming features to Java while being lightweight and fast. I'll probably write a full post on it sometime in the near future.
